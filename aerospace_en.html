        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Aerospace engineering focus on designing, testing and developing aircraft. Aerospace engineers are responsible to solve atmospheric and space flight problems,
        which leads to the division into two branches of this major, which are aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering. Aeronautical engineering focuses on flight within the atmosphere
        while astronautical engineering focuses on spacecraft and launch vehicles. Aerospace engineers develop and invent
        cutting edge technologies for aerospace vehicles including manufacturing methods, materials, propulsion system and others to optimize their performance</p>

        <h3>Example courses:</h3>
        <h4>Numerical, Graphical and Laboratory Techniques for Aerospace Engineering</h4>
        <p>Students will learn computer-based problem solving with Matlab. Besides that, students will also learn aerospace design and 3D solid modeling with CAD tools like SolidWorks</p>
        <h4>Introduction to Performance and Design</h4>
        <p>This courses introduces the aerodynamics of airplane. The main topics are lift and drag, propulsion characteristics of turbojets, level flight, durability, flight design examples and others.</p>
        <h4>Flight Control Systems</h4>
        <p>This course involves linear system analysis. Students will learn the control system designs using root-locus and frequency response methods.</p>
