        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Civil engineering studies the principles of motion and materials to construct and design public and private facilities. Examples of facilities include transportation systems like bridges and buildings, water
            supply, waste management, pollution control, irrigation and drainage systems, reservoirs and others. Environmental engineering is also emphasized in civil engineering, which involves the protecting natural and public health
            providing safe water supply, controlling soil contamination, rural areas sanitation and others. Therefore, civil engineers will have basic knowledge on biology and chemistry.

        <h3>Example courses:</h3>
        <h4>Graphics for Civil Engineering</h4>
        <p>It is a course that integrates graphics, modeling and engineering design. It involves multiview drawings and multi-dimensioning. In this course, students can learn the fundamentals of CAD design.</p>
        <h4>Project Management for Civil Engineers</h4>
        <p>Students will study project management topics like cost estimating, work breakdown structures, project scheduling and others. This course will also go through the planning, design, construction and maintenance processes of a civil engineering project.</p>
        <h4>Principles of Environmental Engineering</h4>
        <p>This course will introduce topics like environmental problems, water sources and treatment methods, water quality indicators and requirements, water pollution control and treatment methods, solid waste management and others.</p>
