        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Mechanical engineering is a multidisciplinary engineering major. Basically, mechanical engineering is to apply the principles of motion, and energy to solve technical problems. 
        Mechanical engineers need to consider the forces and the thermal environment a product will encounter and optimize the design. Besides that, balancing among durability, functionality and aesthetics 
        is also the main job of a mechanical engineer. This major covers a vast variety of industries including automotive, aerospace, electronics, energy and others. In simple words,
        mechanical engineers turns idea into the marketplace.</p>

    <div class="engineering_course">
        <h3>Example courses:</h3>
        <h4>Engineering Graphics and Introductory Design</h4>
        <p>It is a course that integrates graphics, modeling and engineering design. It involves multiview drawings and multi-dimensioning. In this course, students can learn the fundamentals of CAD design.</p>
        <h4>Engineering Dynamics</h4>
        <p>It is a course that studies kinematics. The main topics of this course are kinetics of plane motion, Newton's laws of motion, rigid body problems, linear and angular momentum principles and vibrations.</p>
        <h4>Mechanical Component Design</h4>
        <p>This course studies the philosophy of design. Student will learn to take into consideration stresses and failure models in a design as well as analysis, select and produce machine elements.</p>
