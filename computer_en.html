        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Computer engineering focuses on the study of software systems, embedded systems, information security, Internet networking, computer architecture and others. It provides students the opportunity
            to learn electrical and computer fundamentals. It sits in between the software of computer science and the hardware of electrical engineering. Computer engineers design processors that fits in all
            sizes of electircal appliances like tablet, supercomputers, smartphones, space vehicles, automobiles and others. Special processors like GPU are also designed by computer engineers.
